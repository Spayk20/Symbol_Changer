Symbol_Changer

By building this app, I tried to automate routine manual work with Excel files. This app resolves problems regarding the unique process of choosing the correct email for the lead and swapping non-UTF-8 symbols in first and last names.

Libraries: TkInter, PySide6, PyQt5, Pandas, openpyxl

Symbol_Changer v.1.0 - TkInter + openpyxl

Symbol_Changer v.2.0 - PySide6 + Pandas

Symbol_Changer v.3.0 - PyQt5 + Pandas
